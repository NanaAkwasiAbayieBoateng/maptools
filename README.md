This task view contains information about using R to work with mapping
tools on the wb. The base version of R does not ship with many tools for
interacting with the web. Thankfully, there are an increasingly large
number of tools for interacting with the web. A list of available
packages and functions is presented below, grouped by the type of
activity. If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or
improvements for this taskview, go to Github and [submit an
issue](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools/issues), or make some
changes and [submit a pull
request](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools/pulls). If you can't
contribute on Github, [send Karthik an
email](mailto:karthik@ropensci.org). If you have an issue with one of
the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that
package.

    This package provides a interactive plot device for handling the
    geographic data for web browsers. It is designed for the automatic
    creation of web maps as a combination of users' data and Google Maps
    layers.
-   [rMaps](https://github.com/ramnathv/rMaps): A general purpose
    wrapper around man Javascript mapping libraries, including
    [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/),
