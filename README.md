This task view contains information about using R to obtain and parse
data from the web. The base version of R does not ship with many tools
for interacting with the web. Thankfully, there are an increasingly
large number of tools for interacting with the web. A list of available
packages and functions is presented below, grouped by the type of
activity. If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or
improvements for this taskview, go to Github and [submit an
issue](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices/issues), or make some
changes and [submit a pull
request](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices/pulls). If you can't
contribute on Github, [send Scott an email](mailto:scott@ropensci.org).
If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please
contact the maintainer of that package.

Tools for Working with the Web from R
-------------------------------------

### Parsing Data from the Web

-   txt, csv, etc.: you can use `read.csv()` after acquiring the csv
    file from the web via e.g., `getURL()` from RCurl. `read.csv()`
    works with http but not https, i.e.: `read.csv("http://...")`, but
    not `read.csv("https://...")`.
-   The
    [repmis](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/repmis/index.html)
    package contains a `source_data()` command to load plain-text data
    from a URL (either http or https).
-   The package
    [XML](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html)
    contains functions for parsing XML and HTML, and supports xpath for
    searching XML (think regex for strings). A helpful function to read
    data from one or more HTML tables is `readHTMLTable()`.
-   [XML2R](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML2R/index.html):
    The XML2R package is a collection of convenient functions for
    coercing XML into data frames. The development version is on GitHub
    [here](https://github.com/cpsievert/XML2R).
-   An alternative to
    [XML](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html) is
    [selectr](http://sjp.co.nz/projects/selectr/), which parses CSS3
    Selectors and translates them to XPath 1.0 expressions.
    [XML](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html) package
    is often used for parsing xml and html, but
    [selectr](http://sjp.co.nz/projects/selectr/) translates CSS
    selectors to XPath, so can use the CSS selectors instead of XPath.
    The [selectorgadget browser extension](http://selectorgadget.com/)
    can be used to identify page elements.
-   The [rjson](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjson/index.html)
    converts R object into Javascript object notation (JSON) objects and
    vice-versa.
-   An alternative to the
    [rjson](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjson/index.html) is
    [RJSONIO](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJSONIO/index.html)
    which also converts to and from data in JSON format (it is fast for
    parsing).
-   An alternative to
    [rjson](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjson/index.html) and
    [RJSONIO](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJSONIO/index.html)
    is
    [jsonlite](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html),
    a fork of the
    [RJSONIO](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJSONIO/index.html).
    It includes the parser from RJSONIO, but implements a different
    mapping between R objects and JSON strings.
-   Custom formats: Some web APIs provide custom data formats which are
    usually modified xml or json, and handled by
    [XML](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/index.html) and
    [rjson](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjson/index.html) or
    [RJSONIO](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RJSONIO/index.html),
    respectively.
-   The [RHTMLForms](http://www.omegahat.org/RHTMLForms/) allows to read
    HTML documents and obtain a description of each of the forms it
    contains, along with the different elements and hidden fields
-   [scrapeR](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scrapeR/index.html)
    provides additional tools for scraping data from HTML and XML
    documents.

### Curl, HTTP, FTP, HTML, XML, SOAP

-   [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html): A
    low level curl wrapper that allows one to compose general HTTP
    requests and provides convenient functions to fetch URIs, get/post
    forms, etc. and process the results returned by the Web server. This
    provides a great deal of control over the HTTP/FTP connection and
    the form of the request while providing a higher-level interface
    than is available just using R socket connections. It also provide
    tools for Web authentication.
-   [httr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html): A
    light wrapper around
    [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html)
    that makes many things easier, but still allows you to access the
    lower level functionality of
    [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html). It
    has convenient http verbs: `GET()`, `POST()`, `PUT()`, `DELETE()`,
    `PATCH()`, `HEAD()`, `BROWSE()`. These wrap functions are more
    convenient to use, though less configurable than counterparts in
    [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html).
    The equivalent of httr's `GET()` in
    [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html) is
    `getForm()`. Likewise, the equivalent of
    [httr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html) 's
    `POST()` in
    [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html) is
    `postForm()`. http status codes are helpful for debugging http
    calls. This package makes this easier using, for example,
    `stop_for_status()` gets the http status code from a response
    object, and stops the function if the call was not successful. See
    also `warn_for_status()`. Note that you can pass in additional Curl
    options to the `config` parameter in http calls.
-   The [XMLRPC](http://www.omegahat.org/XMLRPC/) package provides an
    implementation of XML-RPC, a relatively simple remote procedure call
    mechanism that uses HTTP and XML. This can be used for communicating
    between processes on a single machine or for accessing Web services
    from within R.
-   The [XMLSchema](http://www.omegahat.org/XMLSchema/) package provides
    facilities in R for reading XML schema documents and processing them
    to create definitions for R classes and functions for converting XML
    nodes to instances of those classes. It provides the framework for
    meta-computing with XML schema in R
-   [RTidyHTML](http://www.omegahat.org/RTidyHTML/) interfaces to the
    libtidy library for correcting HTML documents that are not
    well-formed. This library corrects common errors in HTML documents.
-   [SSOAP](http://www.omegahat.org/SSOAP/) provides a client-side SOAP
    (Simple Object Access Protocol) mechanism. It aims to provide a
    high-level interface to invoke SOAP methods provided by a SOAP
    server.
-   [Rcompression](http://www.omegahat.org/Rcompression/): Interface to
    zlib and bzip2 libraries for performing in-memory compression and
    decompression in R. This is useful when receiving or sending
    contents to remote servers, e.g. Web services, HTTP requests via
    RCurl.
-   The [CGIwithR](http://www.omegahat.org/CGIwithR/) package allows one
    to use R scripts as CGI programs for generating dynamic Web content.
    HTML forms and other mechanisms to submit dynamic requests can be
    used to provide input to R scripts via the Web to create content
    that is determined within that R script.
-   [httpRequest](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httpRequest/index.html):
    HTTP Request protocols. Implements the GET, POST and multipart POST
    request.

### Authentication

-   Using web resources can require authentication, either via API keys,
    OAuth, username:password combination, or via other means.
    Additionally, sometimes web resources that require authentication be
    in the header of an http call, which requires a little bit of extra
    work. API keys and username:password combos can be combined within a
    url for a call to a web resource (api key:
    http://api.foo.org/?key=yourkey; user/pass:
    http://username:password@api.foo.org), or can be specified via
    commands in
    [RCurl](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RCurl/index.html) or
    [httr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html).
    OAuth is the most complicated authentication process, and can be
    most easily done using
    [httr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html). See
    the 6 demos within
    [httr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html),
    three for OAuth 1.0 (linkedin, twitter, vimeo) and three for OAuth
    2.0 (facebook, github, google).
    [ROAuth](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ROAuth/index.html)
    is a package that provides a separate R interface to OAuth. OAuth is
    easier to to do in
    [httr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html), so
    start there.

### Web Frameworks

-   The [shiny](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html)
    package makes it easy to build interactive web applications with R.
-   The [Rook](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rook/index.html)
    web server interface contains the specification and convenience
    software for building and running Rook applications.
-   The
    [opencpu](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/opencpu/index.html)
    framework for embedded statistical computation and reproducible
    research exposes a web API interfacing R, LaTeX and Pandoc. This API
    is used for example to integrate statistical functionality into
    systems, share and execute scripts or reports on centralized
    servers, and build R based apps.
-   A package by [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/) called
    [servr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/servr/index.html)
    provides a simple HTTP server to serve files under a given directory
    based on the
    [httpuv](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httpuv/index.html)
    package.
-   The
    [httpuv](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httpuv/index.html)
    package, made by Joe Cheng at RStudio, provides low-level socket and
    protocol support for handling HTTP and WebSocket requests directly
    within R. Another related package, perhaps which
    [httpuv](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httpuv/index.html)
    replaces, is
    [websockets](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/websockets/index.html),
    also made by Joe Cheng.
-   [websockets](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/websockets/index.html):
    A simple HTML5 websocket interface for R, made by Joe Cheng.
-   Plot.ly is a company that allows you to create visualizations in the
    web using R (and Python). They have an R package in development
    [here](https://github.com/cparmer/Plotly/tree/master/Ahttp://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R),
    as well as access to their services via an API
    [here](https://plot.ly/API/).
-   The [WADL](http://www.omegahat.org/WADL/) package provides tools to
    process Web Application Description Language (WADL) documents and to
    programmatically generate R functions to interface to the REST
    methods described in those WADL documents.
-   The [RDCOMServer](http://www.omegahat.org/RDCOMServer/) provides a
    mechanism to export R objects as (D)COM objects in Windows. It can
    be used along with the
    [RDCOMClient](http://www.omegahat.org/RDCOMClient/) package which
    provides user-level access from R to other COM servers.
-   The [RSelenium](https://github.com/johndharrison/RSelenium) package
    (not on CRAN) provides a set of R bindings for the Selenium 2.0
    webdriver using the
    [JsonWireProtocol](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol).
    Selenium automates browsers. Using RSelenium you can automate
    browsers locally or remotely. This can aid in automated application
    testing, load testing and web scraping. Examples are given
    interacting with popular projects such as
    [shiny](http://cran.r-project.org/whttp://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html)
    and [sauceLabs](http://saucelabs.com).

### JavaScript

-   [ggvis](https://github.com/rstudio/ggvis) (not on CRAN) makes it
    easy to describe interactive web graphics in R. It fuses the ideas
    of ggplot2 and
    [shiny](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html),
    rendering graphics on the web with Vega.
-   [rCharts](https://github.com/ramnathv/rCharts) (not on CRAN) allows
    for interactive javascript charts from R.
-   [rVega](https://github.com/metagraf/rVega) (not on CRAN) is an R
    wrapper for Vega.

    interactive animation to be defined using a list of ggplots with
    clickSelects and showSelected aesthetics, then exported to
    CSV/JSON/D3/JavaScript for viewing in a web browser.
-   The [SpiderMonkey](http://www.omegahat.org/SpiderMonkey/) package
    provides a means of evaluating JavaScript code, creating JavaScript
    objects and calling JavaScript functions and methods from within R.
    This can work by embedding the JavaScript engine within an R session
    or by embedding R in an browser such as Firefox and being able to
    call R from JavaScript and call back to JavaScript from R.
